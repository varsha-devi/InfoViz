## Data structure

Income data table are given per country.
The attributes present in the tables are:

* **year** the year for the data

* **width** the width of the quntile (high-low)
* **share** the share of the total income captured by this [low, high] quantile
* **cumul** the cumulative share of the quantiles, i.e. the share of [0., high]

## Sample visualizations

* **histogram.html** a basic histogram showing how to select a specific year, and how to use **low**, **high**, **width** and **share**
* **cdf.html** a cumulative distribution function plot showing a use for **cumul**
* **time.html** a time series visualization
